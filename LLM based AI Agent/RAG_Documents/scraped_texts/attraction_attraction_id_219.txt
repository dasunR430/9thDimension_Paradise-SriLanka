	The unique feature of Wilpattu National Park is the existence of "Willus" (Natural lakes) - Natural, sand-rimmed water basins or depressions that fill with rainwater. Nearly sixty lakes (Willu) and tanks are found spread throughout Wilpattu. Located in the Northwest coast lowland dry zone of Sri Lanka.  

 

	The park is located 30 km west Anuradhapura and located 26 km north of Puttalam. The park is 1,317 square kilometers (131, 693 hectares). The best time to visit Wilpattu is during the months of February and October. There are a few private eco-tourism groups that show tourists around the park in Safari like trips. In 1905 the area was designated a sanctuary and in 1938 it was upgraded to the National Park status.
