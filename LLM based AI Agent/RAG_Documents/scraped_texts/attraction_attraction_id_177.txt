	In transit, you can see another little waterfall named Kuda Dunhinda initially. Hence you can taste and revive yourself by having a local home grown drink by the sellers on sides of the path to the water fall. Toward the finish of this adventure you can meet a secured organize developed for the watchers and appreciate the water fall.
