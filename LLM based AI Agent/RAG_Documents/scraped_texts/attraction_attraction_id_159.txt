						 Pigeon Island National Park 
						 

	The national park contains some of the best remaining coral reefs of Sri Lanka. This national park is the 17th in Sri Lanka. The island was used as a shooting range during the colonial era. Pigeon Island is one of the several protected areas affected by the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004. 

 

	Pigeon Island consists of two islands; large pigeon island and small pigeon island. The large pigeon island is fringed by a coral reef, and is about 200 m long and 100 m wide. The national park is situated within the dry zone of Sri Lanka. You can see over 100 species of coral and 300 coral reef fish recorded in the area. Sea Turtles and Blacktip Reef Sharks are also commonly seen in the shallow coral areas.
