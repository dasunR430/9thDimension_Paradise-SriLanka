									 Event Outline 
									 Gateway to South Asia 2017 is an International Travel Fair that will be held from 4 th  to 7 th  May 2017 in Colombo, Sri Lanka. The event programme is as follows: 															
									 4 th  May 2017 evening - Welcome dinner hosted by the Hon. Minister of Tourism 
									
									 5 th  and 6 th  May -  Travel Fair and B2B Meetings at BMICH (Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall) in Colombo	 
									
									 7 th  May -  Day excursion to Heritage Cities Kandy/Galle/Colombo. 
									
									
									 
										 The main goal of Gateway to South Asia 2017 is to attract 250 new tour operators to Sri Lanka. These operators will be from existing and emerging markets primarily identified by the airlines operating in Sri Lanka from their respective online operating destinations with inbound traffic targeted from winter season 2017. 
										
										 Gateway to South Asia 2017 will facilitate the government's effort to achieve 4 million tourist arrivals by 2020 which is spearheaded by the Hon. Minister of Tourism Development, Lands and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga. Minister Amaratunga has appointed travel trade veteran and former Ceylon Tourist Board Chairman, Mr. Udaya Nanayakkara as Chairman, Organizing Committee. 
										
										 With the rapidly changing landscape of international travel where traditional tour operators are making way for direct online booking platforms, it is imperative to reach out to the new generation of travelers who prefer to travel guided by social media. In this respect it is proposed to reach out to travel influencers like bloggers, online travel portals, booking platforms and travel journalists through Gateway to South Asia 2017. 
										
										 The event will also be used as a platform to attract investment to the country by showcasing the government's development programmes such as the Megapolis Plan and tourism infrastructure development projects like the airport expansion which will enable handling of the biggest aircraft such as Airbus A380 etc., development of new highways and similar projects. 										
										 In order to make the travel fair an attractive proposition, 4-5 star class city hotels, airlines and logistics service providers have already offered special concessionary rates for participants. 
										
										 As mentioned the main focus will be on attracting new tour operators in new markets and two invitations will be extended to each participant company. The event is being synchronized with ''Sancharaka Udawa'' local travel fair and the dates have been specifically selected so as to not clash with any other international travel event and ahead of the busy summer period. The timing will also complement the launch of the destination marketing promotion that is to be launched by Sri Lanka Tourism. 
										
										 Gateway to South Asia 2017 will be a high profile event where besides the main exhibition other affiliated events such as fashion shows, gem exhibitions etc. will also take place. Visits will be offered to participants covering places of interest across the island. International media will be invited for the event along with well-known international celebrities. 
										
										
										 The growth and survival of Sri Lanka's tourism industry depends on initiatives of this nature. Gateway to South Asia 2017 will be a carefully curated event that will sustain and grow tourism in Sri Lanka towards the target of 4 million arrivals by 2020 and upgrade tourism income to a higher level.
